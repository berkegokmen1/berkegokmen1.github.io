## About Me

I am a Computer Science student at <a href="https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/">Bilkent University</a>, passionate about computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

I'm currently looking for PhD or MSc opportunities to further my research in deep learning and computer vision.

## Research
